            <h2>Introduction to NetsBlox</h2>
            <h5>Akos Ledeczi</h5>
            <p>
                A brief introduction to NetsBlox, including a look at some recent additions.
                NetsBlox is a block-based programming environment that opens up the internet to novice programmers, supporting distributed computation, computer networking, robotics, cybersecurity, the Internet of Things, and many more.
                As a recent development, your program can even access your phone's sensors and turn it into a game controller.

            <h2>NetsBlox: Block-Based Distributed Programming</h2>
            <h5>Brian Broll</h5>
            <p>
                A brief introduction to NetsBlox, an open-source extension for Snap!, which demonstrates some of the powerful networking and query tools that are available to students.
                In this talk, we demonstrate how some of these tools could be used to grab images from Google Maps, complete with panning and zooming, collect and display animated solar eclipse data, read and plot historical earthquake data, and displaying images pulled from the IMDB database.

            <h3>Snap!Con 2020: <br> Exploring Climate Change with Programming Projects</h3>
            <h5>Akos Ledeczi, Corey Brady, Brian Broll</h5>
            <p>
                In this short talk, we present the results of a multi-disciplinary collaboration between earth scientists, education researchers and computer scientists, including undergraduate and graduate students and faculty.
                The goal of the project was to design a set of curricular components that teach about climate change and computational thinking in a synergistic manner.
                We utilized a Snap! extension called NetsBlox.
                NetsBlox is an open source, browser-based visual programming environment and corresponding cloud-infrastructure that integrates distributed programming capabilities at a level accessible for novice programmers.
                One of the new abstractions, Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) provide students’ programs access to online services and data sources including Google Maps, weather, NOAA climate change data, and others, as well as services created by the end-user community and hosted on the NetsBlox server.
                RPCs enable students to create engaging and motivating projects grounded in real-world applications.

            <h3>Snap!Con 2020: <br> Build Your Own (Data) Services in NetsBlox</h3>
            <h5>Brian Broll, Corey Brady, Akos Ledeczi</h5>
            <p>
                In this workshop, we will present how data services can be created in NetsBlox.
                First, we will start with a brief introduction to NetsBlox.
                Next, we will show what kinds of data service are possible, through a few examples.
                Then, we’ll work with participants to create their own data services.
                Next, we will show how NetsBlox determines intelligent default configuration options based on the contents of the dataset (as a CSV file).
                Finally, we will explore options for customizing the data service (by editing the generated configuration), ranging from the help messages to the implementations of the individual remote procedure calls (RPCs).

            <h3>Snap!Con 2021: <br> NetsBlox: Bringing the Full Power of the Internet to Snap!</h3>
            <h5>Akos Ledeczi and Brian Broll</h5>
            <p>
                In this talk we will present an overview of NetsBlox as well as some of the newest features including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Accessing your phone’s sensors from your project and placing interactive GUI elements on the screen. This enables applications like 1) an exercise tracker showing your route on a map and displaying the distance covered and your speed or 2) turning your phone into a remote sprite controller.</li>
                    <li>A Virtual Reality environment where students get virtual robots that they can control with their NetsBlox programs. They can collaborate on tasks in this shared world or compete against each other.</li>
                    <li>Create and deploy your own Alexa skill while writing it entirely in NetsBlox.</li>
                    <li>Create a suite of auto-graded assignments within NetsBlox itself.</li>
                    <li>Make your own data available to any other user of NetsBlox anywhere in the world instantly.</li>
                </ul>

            <h5>Shuchi Grover</h5>
            <p>
                Teaching frontiers of CS in secondary school: gender equity, data science, transdisciplinary learning, and teacher professional development.
                In this keynote address, Dr. Shuchi Grover presents work on an NSF-funded project, 'Beyond CS Principles: Engaging Female High School Students in New Frontiers of Computing', a collaboration between Vanderbilt University, North Carolina State University and Looking Glass Ventures, CA. 
                The keynote ends with a discussion of the Koli Calling 2020 paper: 'FIRST Principles to Design for Online, Synchronous High School CS Teacher Training and Curriculum Co-Design' by Shuchi Grover, Veronica Catete, Tiffany Barnes, Marnie Hill, Akos Ledeczi, and Brian Broll.
