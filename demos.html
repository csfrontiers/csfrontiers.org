            <h3>Snap!Con 2020: <br> Build Your Own (Data) Services in NetsBlox</h3>
            <h5>Brian Broll, Corey Brady, Akos Ledeczi</h5>
            <p>
                In this workshop, we will present how data services can be created in NetsBlox.
                First, we will start with a brief introduction to NetsBlox.
                Next, we will show what kinds of data service are possible, through a few examples.
                Then, we’ll work with participants to create their own data services.
                Next, we will show how NetsBlox determines intelligent default configuration options based on the contents of the dataset (as a CSV file).
                Finally, we will explore options for customizing the data service (by editing the generated configuration), ranging from the help messages to the implementations of the individual remote procedure calls (RPCs).

            <h3>Snap!Con 2020: <br> Exploring Climate Change with Programming Projects</h3>
            <h5>Akos Ledeczi, Corey Brady, Brian Broll</h5>
            <p>
                In this short talk, we present the results of a multi-disciplinary collaboration between earth scientists, education researchers and computer scientists, including undergraduate and graduate students and faculty.
                The goal of the project was to design a set of curricular components that teach about climate change and computational thinking in a synergistic manner.
                We utilized a Snap! extension called NetsBlox.
                NetsBlox is an open source, browser-based visual programming environment and corresponding cloud-infrastructure that integrates distributed programming capabilities at a level accessible for novice programmers.
                One of the new abstractions, Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) provide students’ programs access to online services and data sources including Google Maps, weather, NOAA climate change data, and others, as well as services created by the end-user community and hosted on the NetsBlox server.
                RPCs enable students to create engaging and motivating projects grounded in real-world applications.

            <h2>NetsBlox: Block-Based Distributed Programming</h2>
            <h5>Brian Broll</h5>
            <p>
                A brief introduction to NetsBlox, an open-source extension for Snap!, which demonstrates some of the powerful networking and query tools that are available to students.
                In this talk, we demonstrate how some of these tools could be used to grab images from Google Maps, complete with panning and zooming, collect and display animated solar eclipse data, read and plot historical earthquake data, and displaying images pulled from the IMDB database.
