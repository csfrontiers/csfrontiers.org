    <h3>Internet of Things & Software Engineering</h3>
    <p>Experience working hands-on with internet-connected devices beyond your own computer by using our virtual robotics environment. The programming interface is identical regardless of whether the connected devices are physical or simulated. Use your own phones and tablets via the PhoneIoT app activity. What you create with the NetsBlox program will have full access to all the sensors on the phone and will even build a GUI on its screen. You will create engaging apps while learning the basics of networked sensing. In the second week you will work in teams, pitch a project idea, develop a program in sprints, and present your final product. You will also have the opportunity to hear talks from current computer scientists doing work in the field of IoT and Cybersecurity!</p>

    <h3>Artificial Intelligence & Software Engineering</h3>
    <p>Learn about how to find Twitter bots, do sentiment analysis on your favorite artists, and more! During this camp, you will learn about how computer scientists use various Artificial Intelligence techniques to analyze data. You will learn about the role Artificial Intelligence plays in our daily lives by looking at its influence on the criminal justice system and the environment. You will also have the opportunity to hear talks from current computer scientists doing work in the field of Artificial Intelligence!</p>

    <h3>Camp Format</h3>
    <p>When signing up for a camp, participants are expected to <strong>choose either AI or the Internet of Things as their starting topic</strong>. Each participant will also <strong>end their program with a week of Software Engineering</strong>. If participants would like to add in a third week with the remaining topic, requests will be accommodated based on space availability.</p>
