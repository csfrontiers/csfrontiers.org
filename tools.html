    <h2 class='center'>NetsBlox</h2>
    <p>
        NetsBlox is an open-source web- and cloud-based visual programming environment.
        Its visual notation is based on Scratch from MIT and uses the open source JavaScript code base of Snap! from Berkeley.
        Both of these are extremely successful tools in K12 computer science education.
        NetsBlox adds the capability of networking and enables distributed programming at a level accessible to young learners.
        This helps teach 21st century skills and makes programming more engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
        NetsBlox also enables programs running on separate computers to talk to each other.
        Hence, students can write multi-player games such as Tic Tac Toe or Battleship and other truly distributed programs.
        NetsBlox supports collaborative program editing similar to how Google Docs work.
        This opens up new ways of project-based learning, new ways of teaching, as well as enables pair programming even when students are not sitting at the same table.
        Unlimited undo/redo is also supported.
    </p>
    <p>
        NetsBlox opens up the internet with its vast array of public domain scientific and other data sources making it possible to create STEM projects such as displaying seismic activity anywhere on Earth using an interactive Google Maps background.
        Similarly, weather, air pollution, and many other data sources such as the Open Movie Database and the Sloan Digital Sky Server are available.
        We are adding new services on a regular basis.
        The same facility can help implement more complicated multi-player games by providing server-side support.

    <p>
        If you prefer a more hands-on learning experience, there is plenty of information built into the <a href='https://editor.netsblox.org' target='_blank'>NetsBlox editor</a> to introduce you to some of the new features it has added to Snap!
        Drag and drop any block from the left menu into the center; you can click on any block to execute it individually, or connect them together to perform complex logic.
        One of the primary focuses of NetsBlox is the <strong>Network</strong> tab in the upper left corner, which has many advanced blocks for performing complex internet exchanges in a way that is still extremely simple.
        If you're ever unsure of how to use a block, you can right click it and select <strong>help...</strong> for more information.
